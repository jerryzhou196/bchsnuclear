		<h2 class="editable">Nuclear Energy. Where does it come from and is it renewable? </h2>
		<p class="subtext editable"> 
		The source of nuclear energy comes from <strong> chemical potential energy, </strong> more specifically, the splitting of uranium atoms to spin turbines. However, whether nuclear energy is renewable energy has been the subject of major and very controversial debate. To put matters into perspective, it is important to first take heed to what the definition of renewable energy even is. 
<br> <br> <strong> Renewable energy is defined as an energy source/fuel type that can regenerate and can replenish itself indefinitely. </strong> <br> <br>

As someone doing research into the topic, it is important to find light in both perspectives since the renewability of nuclear energy is not black and white. 

<br> <br> <strong> <i> The perspective that nuclear energy is renewable. </i> </strong> <br>

Much support of nuclear energy centralizes around it’s low carbon emission as its major characteristic to be defined as renewable energy. According to nuclear power opponents, if the goal to build a renewable energy infrastructure is to lower carbon emission then there is no reason for not including nuclear energy in that list. 

But one of the most interesting arguments for including nuclear energy in the renewable energy portfolio came from Bernard L Cohen, former professor at University of Pittsburg. Professor Cohen defined the term 'indefinite'(time span required for an energy source to be sustainable enough to be called renewable energy) in numbers by using the expected relationship between the sun (source of solar energy) and the earth. According to Professor Cohen, if the Uranium deposit could be proved to last as long as the relationship between the Earth and Sun is supposed to last (5 billion years) then nuclear energy should be included in the renewable energy portfolio. 


<br> <br> <strong> <i> The perspective that nuclear energy is non-renewable. </i> </strong> <br>

One of the biggest arguments against including nuclear energy in the list of renewables is the fact that uranium deposits on earth are finite, unlike solar and wind. To be counted as renewable, the energy source (fuel) should be sustainable for an indefinite period of time, according to the definition of renewable energy.

			<h3 class="editable">How does the technology work? </h3>
			<p class="editable">
As mentioned earlier, the crux of nuclear energy lies within the chemical potential energy of uranium, which when compared to 1kg of coal will give you <strong> 2 to 3 million times more kWh of heat by mass. </strong> This goes to show the incredible efficiency of the technology relative to fossil fuel combustion. 

Nuclear energy begins with rods of uranium which are arranged in bundles and put into a giant water tank inside a nuclear reactor. When the reactor is running, high-speed particles (neutrons) hit the uranium atoms present within these rods and split them. This releases lots of energy and more neutrons, which go on to split other uranium atoms, triggering a chain reaction. 
<br> <br> <img src = "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/nuclearfission.svg"> <br> <br> 

This process - known as fission - generates heat to produce steam, which is used by a turbine generator to generate electricity. Because nuclear power plants do not burn fuel, they do not produce greenhouse gas emissions.  In a boiling water reactor, shown below, the water is allowed to boil into steam, and is then sent through a turbine to produce electricity.

In pressurized water reactors, the core water is held under pressure and not allowed to boil. The heat is transferred to water outside the core with a heat exchanger (also called a steam generator), boiling the outside water, generating steam, and powering a turbine. Why go through this middle man of a heat exchanger? 
It is done in pressurized water reactors so that the water does not directly touch the fission process, and thereby does not become radioactive.

Through an environmental perspective, the greatest benefit associated with nuclear power is that it doesn’t emit any greenhouse gases, unlike coal and natural gas. As a result of this, nuclear energy does not contribute to climate change. In the murkiness of our contemporary world where climate change is rendering the world into an ever more dire situation, nuclear energy is becoming more attractive. In addition, nuclear power plants are also much more resilient than other forms of energy. While long droughts inhibit hydroelectric plants and hurricanes can destroy solar and wind farms, the reinforced nature of nuclear plants allow them to run 24/7.  In addition, another environmental perspective includes the plutonium byproduct produced by the reaction, which has to be disposed of by isolated storage boxes buried deep within the earth due to the lack of a absolute disposal method.   

 <br> <br> 

Through a social perspective, nuclear energy plants have a much higher stigma compared to other forms of energy. Popular culture games such as Fallout and heavily documented nuclear disasters have cast a harshly ugly light upon nuclear energy, making several residents feel uneasy around them. This forced large industrial nuclear plants offshore and pushed gas-fired electricity costs toward 10 cents/kWh due to more investment. 


<br> <br> 

Through a economic perspective, Nuclear plants also creates much more jobs than other forms of energy. They create 0.5 jobs for every megawatt hour of electricity produced. This is in comparison to 0.19 jobs in coal, 0.05 jobs in gas-fired plants and 0.05 in wind power. The only other power source that creates more jobs/mWh is solar photovoltaic. This source generates 1.06 jobs/mWh. In addition, nuclear power has the cheapest operating costs, running at 1.87 cents/kWh, only 68% of the cost of coal and 25% the cost of natural gas. Nuclear fuel is also efficient. About 28 grams of uranium releases as much energy as 100 metric tons of coal. As a result, transportation is less expensive.



<h1 class = "editable"> What steps have industries taken to reduce or eliminate the environmental impacts associated with nuclear energy? </h1>
 <br> <p class = "editable"> Currently, the central environmental impact of nuclear energy is the management of radioactive waste. From its inception to now, industries have taken better solutions in terms of disposing of the waste. Initially, most industries simply dumped the radioactive waste into lakes and ponds, causing havoc to ensue within tightly balanced ecosystems. Now, all short-lived, low and intermediate level nuclear waste are disposed of using surface or under-ground repositories that are safe for people and the environment during the time that these wastes maintain their radioactivity. These wastes represent over 90% of total radioactive waste and are conditioned and stored in facilities isolated from the environment by specially engineered barriers. There is no immediate economic, environmental or technological need that stems from this solution but from a sustainable development perspective, it boils down to placing the burden of finding a permanent solution to the future generation. That being said, the safety of geological disposal has been present throughout nature. Until about over three thousand million years ago, a naturally-made reactor moderated by currents of water operated for millions of years at a uranium ore deposit and the material produced during the nuclear fission reaction hardly moved from its original location. The concept of deep geological disposal is more than 40 years old, and the technology for building and operating such repositories is now mature enough for deployment.

  <h3> Climate change has proven itself to be more than just a temporary issue. Science has said that if we don’t make any dramatic changes in the next 11 years, our world’s pollution rates would reach an irreversible threshold.

    <div class="card-body"><strong> <i> WATER </i> </strong> <br> Statistics show that the average Calgarian uses 329 litres of water per person, per day with the largest two contributors being bathing,showering and toilets. Major waste reduction can be achieved through few, shorter showers and preventing unnecessary water flow. It is also estimated that 7.5 litres of water go down the drain when running the water until it’s cold; enough to provide four people with enough drinking water for the day. Instead of letting the faucet run, fill a water jug and keep it refrigerated. Wash clothes in cold water and hang them to dry. Roughly 80-90% of the energy used by a washing machine goes into heating the water. Dryers, in turn, use ten times more energy than a washing machine. When possible, skip the dryer altogether.

			<h3 class="editable"> The feasibility of nuclear energy in Alberta. What do I think?</h3>
			<p class="editable">Before I say my individual opinion on the feasibility of nuclear energy in Alberta, it is important to realize the circumstances that surround the province. Pervaded by right-wing politics, Calgary and Edmonton are natural gas powerhouses. With its power generation privatized and our energy primarily generated through our enormous oil industry, right wing politics stretch deep within Western Canada. With all of this in mind, I would say the feasibility of nuclear energy within Alberta is highly unlikely. As the pumping heart of Canada’s oil industry, politics and corporations have become inextricably linked. Hundreds of thousands of jobs exist within Alberta’s natural gas industry and for the government to suddenly introduce nuclear energy into Alberta would be costly, unnecessary and would probably be silenced by corporate  oil lobbyists. In addition, the displacement of the natural gas industry along with the influence that these multi-million dollar oil corporations exercise on our leadership would squash any possible attempts of introducing nuclear energy. Individually, I would also not support it. With relatives and families who have grown to depend their entire livelihood on the oil industry, jeopardizing it by introducing nuclear energy could and would destroy lives and the tens of years spent studying at universities and colleges. The initial investment it would require would also impact an already crippled Alberta economy that has been slowly trying to get back on it’s two feet. It is interesting to note that Nuclear generation has been considered in all Alberta, Skatchewan and Nova Scotia, but has not been developed have no plans to build any nuclear facilities. The Alberta government stated that it would consider nuclear power plants on a case-by-case basis and that no government resources would be spent on developing nuclear energy.
